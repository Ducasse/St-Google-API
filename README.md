# St-Google-API
Richard Prinz's Google Service Discovery API Generator. For more info, read his [excellent blog post](https://www.min.at/prinz/?x=entry:entry150318-104537) or visit the [original code repo](http://www.min.at/prinz/repo/gapi).

Forked to ease collaboration because he was hosting his own code repo, I needed to fix some bugs, and had no idea what the process was.
